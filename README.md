This is a Dribbble API resource built with [nanoc](https://github.com/nanoc/nanoc).

## Development

[Foreman](https://github.com/ddollar/foreman) is used to start the nanoc compiler and server.

```sh
$ gem install foreman
$ foreman start
14:15:20 serve.1 | started with pid 38744
14:15:20 watch.1 | started with pid 38745
14:15:22 watch.1 | 14:16:22 - INFO - Guard is using TerminalTitle to send notifications.
14:15:22 watch.1 | 14:16:22 - INFO - Compilation succeeded.
14:15:32 watch.1 | 14:16:32 - INFO - Guard is now watching at 'api-documentation'
```

You can then view the site at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).
